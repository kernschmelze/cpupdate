# cpupdate
Microcode utility for BSD

The manual page is not yet converted to nroff, read it here please:<br>
http://bsd.denkverbot.info/2018/03/cpupdate-manpage-suggestion.html<br>

Note the program is still WIP.<br>
Please do not install via pkg, only with ports. (sysutils/cpupdate).<br>

After you did <make install>, it is still necessary to create the directories for the microcodes and move the microcode files deposited in the directories listed in the notice that gets printed after the installer is finished.<br>

There are also some temporary notes, covering the directories used etc:<br>
